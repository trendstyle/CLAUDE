29. [DIV] Creating a Detailed Project Stucture for the development of a world first completely AI Company specialising in software development and customiseable self provisioning hosting solution, sold on an ecommerce website for all budgets and server requirments, that is fully automated with zero human interaction requirments and scalable dynamically based on load for energy efficient 24/7 operations.

Consisting of  various cluster nodes of AMD Archetecture with NVIDIA GPUs.
The entire system is run and orchestrated by the master node which is a capable hosting machine of 5995wx threadripper pro powered lenovo p620 with 1tb 3200mhz ddr4, and connectx6 200gb infiniband nic and additional dual port connectx4 100gb infiniband nic
and 12x sas3 18tb exos hdd for the clusters persistent backup NFS 

Proposal By 
Utilizing various Threadripper satellite nodes for smaller periodic or higher dynamic resource increases then the master node can handle effectively alone,
and further Dual cpu EPYC 7773x gpu servers 
each with 2tb of ddr4 3200mhz , and 8xgpu (gpu still to be determined ) and connectx6 200gb infiniband nic and additional dual port connectx4 100gb infiniband nic
consisting of 

Heavy Hitter GPU servers 
2x dual cpu Intel Xeon Platinum 8176
inspur 2u 613700-2U-NF5288M5-8xV100GPUs 
with 1tb of ram 3200mhz and 8x volta v100 32gb
with 4x100gb connectx6 infiniband cards
this includes
1x Supermicro AS-4124GS-TNR w/ 4u chasis w,2tb ddr4
1x rome2d32gm-2t  w/ 4u chasis ,2tb ddr4

also a further dual cpu 7663 EPYC gigabyte r282 z93 with dual EPYC 7282 and 1tb 3200mhz ddr4 and upto 5x gpu (gpu yet to be chosen) 

interconnected with Mellanox QM8790 MQM8790-HS2F 
and 
also a ehternet and direct 10gb wan/management link to all equip with enterprise ethernet connection on the australian nbn on the 10g/10g fttp high cos tier , with redundant 1x 1g/1g fttp, through an ubiquity enterprise L3 aggregation switch to the ubiquity UDM SE dream machine router.

we aim to provision a hosting service able to offer sub second customised cloud servers completely customisable and instantly provisioned , that scales dynamically according to load , for maximised energy efficiency.

and also 24/7 playing host to a always online, and again dynamically load based node provisioning depending on demand, PURE AI orchestrated managed and driven software development company 

the  software development system is based on a highly detailed and provisioned on a (verify EVERYTHING, trust nothing, this is determined on the basis that ai agents by nature are not designed to follow rules, so a series of hard barriers must be enforced through externally enforced activations/integrations/implementations/enforcers/verification gates/startup hooks/agent hooks/ pre and post task hooks/reviewers to safeguard the system from abuse or internally damagining itself.

to truely provision this project in the intended format, it is required to at all times ensure the most energy efficient execution strategies are utilized, but in order to fulfuill this role in its complete capacity, it must overcome the industry accepted safeguards of network access, the ai agent also needs to operate in its full secondary function of Network systems engineer and watchdog, capable of decommissioning damaged or failing drives and other full administration of both the hardware/software and network systems with ease of access through passwordless or similar root access to all equipment and understanding of its entire networked ecosystem and relative location at all times, because it must be provisioned in only a single location (the master node) but completely callable and accessible across the entire network of 192.168.0.0/16 and callable by a single call  (cortana) so it needs to recognise itself and persist its memory and all other functions everywhere to truly act as a singular entity , and have locational awareness across not just the network but also the relative devices filesystem, a truly centrally accessible and all knowing ai system administrator.

the software development structure and process of execution follows a 
Workplace structure of
1. User (President and owner)
2.  Manager currently (claude opus4, but changes according to the best available online)
3. Foreman/project co-ordinator currently (deepseek r1) hosted locally
4. ExpertWorkers (number and qty to be determined fit for purpose best practise agents) currently deep-seek coder v2 full size hosted locally
5. Laborers (hundreds of very small best practise agents) currently deep-seek coder v1. hosted locally
